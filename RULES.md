# Flower War

## Rules of Play

Flower war can be played with 2-6 players (but it's currently optimized for four)

## Turn Order

The player playing East always goes first because the sun always rises in the East. From there it can go in any order but West always goes last because the sun always sets in the west. 

### Every Turn

Each turn a player takes a series of actions:

1. Roll to move to a different space
2. Pick up a skull from the new space
3. Battle anyone who is currently on the space.
4. Make sacrifices to the gods
5. Play cards

### Making Sacrifices

On each turn, players may make sacrifices to either Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, or Tlaloc, the god of rain, or both. To make a sacrifice, a player gives a skull to the god of their choice by putting it into the slot on the Templo Mayor in front of the temple of either Tlaloc or Huitzilopochtli. They can then draw a card from the deck of the god that they made a sacrifice to. 

### Battles

If two players are on the same space, they must battle. The player who moved to the space attacks, while the player who was there already defends. 

Each player rolls 1D and the player with the higher total wins. The loser pays one skull to the winner. 

#### Battling with Cards (optional)

After the initial dice roll, cards may be played during battle. Cards used during battle are placed face up under the current space on the board, and the cost of the cards in skulls is added the the current space. Cards may be used up to the current space total by either player. 

The attacker goes first, playing one card. The defender goes next, and plays a card. This may repeat until either the players run out of cards, or the space runs out of capacity for skulls, whichever comes first. 

Once the total has been finalized, a skull plus any modifiers added is paid by the loser to the winner.

### Playing Cards

Cards can be used on each turn or during battle. Cards have a cost in both sacrifice (one skull) and printed on each card, ranging from free to three or even five skulls. The cost printed on the card must be paid in full to be able to use the card. To use a card, skulls must be paid to the space that the player is on. For example, if four skulls have been removed from the current space, then cards valuing up to four skulls may be played on that space. Skulls are added to the tzomplantli as they are played. 

Once played, the card is placed face up under the current space on the board. 

### Discarding Cards

When cards are used, discarded, or sacrificed they are placed under the space on the board that they were used on, for example, if the card for Tlaloc's Tears were played on the space Miquiztli, the card would be placed under that space on the board, face up with Tlaloc's Tears showing. Each card played is placed face up on top of the last. 

Cards, artifacts, or trap cards with lingering effects last until they are covered by another card and can be triggered by a player moving onto that space.

### Triggering the Apocalypse

Each space is guarded by a tzompantli holding 12 skulls. When all skulls from the tzompantli have been removed, the calendar disc may be picked up. 

Once a calendar disc has been picked up, the rule change is effected immediately, and the countdown to the apocalypse begins. The player who picked up the first calendar disc is responsible for maintaining the apocalypse countdown. 

### Counting Down the Apocalypse

Each time the apocalypse counter's turn comes up they add one bead to the apocalpyse tzompantli UNLESS the sacrifices between the two gods of the Templo Mayor are exactly even, which forestalls the count.

When the apocalpyse tzompantli is full that signfies the last round. Once the final skull is reached, the game is over.
