# Flower War

## Rules of Play

Flower war can be played with 2-6 players (but it's currently optimized for four)

## Turn Order

The player playing East always goes first because the sun always rises in the East. From there it can go in any order but West always goes last because the sun always sets in the west. 

### Every Turn

Each turn a player takes a series of actions:

1. Roll to move to a different space
2. Pick up a skull from the new space
3. Battle anyone who is currently on the space.
4. Make sacrifices to the gods
5. Play cards

### First Turn

The player who moves first does not pick up the skull on their starting space. All other players do. This is to balance first move advantage. 

### Making Sacrifices

On each turn, players may make sacrifices to either Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, or Tlaloc, the god of rain, or both. To make a sacrifice, a player gives a skull to the god of their choice. They can then draw a card from the deck of the god that they made a sacrifice to. 

### Using Cards

Cards may be used on each turn or during battle. Cards have a cost in both sacrifice (one skull) and printed on each card, ranging from free to three or even five skulls. The cost printed on the card must be paid in full to be able to use the card.

Once played, the card is placed face up under the current space on the board. 

### Discarding Cards

When cards are used, discarded, or sacrificed they are placed under the space on the board that they were used on, for example, if the card for Tlaloc's Tears were played on the space Miquiztli, the card would be placed under that space on the board, face up with Tlaloc's Tears showing. Each card played is placed face up on top of the last. 

Cards, artifacts, or trap cards with lingering effects last until they are covered by another card and can be triggered by a player moving onto that space.

### Triggering the Apocalypse

Each space is guarded by a tzompantli holding 12 skulls. When all skulls from the tzompantli have been removed, the calendar disc may be picked up. 

Once a calendar disc has been picked up, the rule change is effected immediately, and the countdown to the apocalypse begins. The player who picked up the first calendar disc is responsible for maintaining the apocalypse countdown. 

### Counting Down the Apocalypse

Each time the apocalypse counter's turn comes up they add one bead to the apocalpyse tzompantli UNLESS the sacrifices between the two gods of the Templo Mayor are exactly even, which forestalls the count.

When the apocalpyse tzompantli is full that signfies the last round. Once the final skull is reached, the game is over.
