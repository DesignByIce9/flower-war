# Card Descriptions

All summary card descriptions will go here with individual card discussions going with their respective assets.

## Card Packs

Cards are sold in packs of 13 cards, six Tlaloc cards, six Huitzilopochtli, and one rare card. Booster packs contain all 20 land cards and one legendary card. Each game requires a minimum of two booster packs, one for each god, and at least two card packs for each god (4 card packs total) recommended. The number of cards in the deck both increases variety and gameplay. 

## Card Groups

There are several categories of cards.

### Land Cards 

Land cards send a player to a specific space on the board. This allows them to collect an extra skull in a given turn and potentially battle another player.
