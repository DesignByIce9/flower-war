# Week Cards (20)

Twenty cards represent each day (space) on the board. Collecting these cards by landing on a space 13 times or as gifts from the Gods provide bonuses to the player by embodying the spirit of the day.

If a player holds the card for a day, anyone who lands on that space must pay them a tribute of one token to occupy it. This tribute is paid even if a battle occurs on the space.

The three winning cards can also be collected as week cards. If more than one player holds a week card, tribute is paid to all players that hold the card.
