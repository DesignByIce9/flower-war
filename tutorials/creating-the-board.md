# Creating the Flower War Board

Important note: this will NOT work on a regular sized desktop printer. You need to be able to print at least 11" wide. I use an Epson Expression 960 and Epson 11x14 Presentation Matte paper for this, but you can use anything that works. 


### Step 1: Download the assets

Download the flower war board files from the /assets folder in the most convenient format for you (usually JPEG). Print them at 11x14 or 11x17 depending on the size of the paper you have available to you. Make sure that you print borderless and DO NOT SCALE. If you don't have a large format printer at home, you can have these printed at like a Staples or an Office Max for cheap. Make sure you tell them the same thing I just told you: DO NOT SCALE. 

### Step 2: Cut the Board

Using the SVG files and a Cricut or Silhoutte machine (or any other cutter... or an Xacto... or your cool laser eye beams) cut out four 10.5" wedges from either 2mm chipboard, 1.5mm chipboard, or kraft board. Or anything, really. Stone if you can. 

### Step 3: Cut the Print-Outs

I just used an Xacto knife for this step. Place the chipboard over the print-out and use it as a cutting guide. Takes like four seconds. Do this four times for a total of sixteen seconds.

### Step 4: Spray Gloss

Seal the inkjet prints with a spray gloss, spray clear, or matte coating. Allow time to dry. Spray multiple coats.

### Step 5: Glue

Spray the chipboard with spray adhesive or evenly coat it with tacky glue, rubber cement, Elmer's or other paper glue. For Elmer's you'll probably want to water it down. I recommend spray glue because it's like spray cheese except glue. Don't use spray cheese for this.

### Assemble the Board

Once everything is dry, put the four pieces together on a table. You can tape them together on the bottom to keep them from slipping out of place.
