# Day Cards

Day cards tell the story of the Aztec people as they wander nomadically searching for the sign to settle their city.

Day cards are acquired by landing in a space with a day count of zero (13 tokens remaining) or by sacrificing 7 tokens to Mary.

Day cards contain events such as victory cards, gifts from gods, or penalties from gods in the form of bonuses or detriments. They can also be acquired by other events.

Day cards are the most common cards in the game, and the weakest.
