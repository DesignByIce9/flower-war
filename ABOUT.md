# What is Flower War?

Flower War is an open source educational strategy game. This is the first game I have ever designed, although I am a professional app designer. This is my personal passion project and it is entirely self-funded so far. My hope is to share my love and respect for the Aztec empire with the rest of the world. 

Because of that, I decided that the best way to go forward was to open source the game and share my creation journey, as well as any assets that are created along the way with the world. Flower War is not just a cool game about the Aztecs, it's also a platform that you can use to build your own game. Flower War is easily remixed into other games, and creating these assets was quite a bit of work, so if you would like to use these assets to help with building your own game, go for it!

If you do remix Flower War, please fork the repo on GitHub or let us know and we will share your remix here and on the official Flower War social media!

## Why Flower War

Ok this is going to sound weird. Actually it already sounds weird, so I'm just going to go for it. When I was a teenager I had a dream about a war. A man, a guerilla fighter, had been shot in the battle. He was dying while laying against a tree. A woman saw him and screamed and came to him. He must have been her husband. As the battle raged on around us, we were transported back in time and instead of modern guerilla fighters with guns we were in the middle of an Aztec battle instead. The woman, looked at me. I recognized her as my friend Mary Battle. Being a teenager, I wrote this into a poem called Mary, a Battle, which I then promptly lost.

But the idea stayed in my head, and I wrote more poems about this battle with Mary and her lover whose name I never knew. As I learned more about Mexico and the Aztec empire, I learned about Mary of Guadalupe, a perfect stand-in for Mary Battle for my poems. The poetry shifted and became a love poem. It was haunting, and eerie, and as I grew up, had no place in my life. 

So, I carried these poems around with me not sure what to do with them. I wanted to make a film, or a video game, but those are very resource instensive. After talking to my friends Natalie and Dan -- Natalie is a board game enthusiast and her husband Dan is a game designer -- I was inspired to create a board game version of the Mary poems. Flower War is that. It is a fever dream of a teenage memory encapulated into an artist's vision. It uses history to convey its message, but first and foremost, it's an art piece. 

#### Can I read the poetry though?

Of course. Do you think I would bring it up and not post it? This whole game is just an excuse to publish my poetry in some context that isn't "hey look at my poetry" ... It's in the /lore section. There really isn't all that much of it because I'm really bad at keeping up with poems. I'll add more as I find it and/or write it.
